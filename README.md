# `Tshirt design editor` â€” Angularjs app with MySQL backend

This project is an Angularjs application that Utilizes [Fabric.js][fabric.js] library to make an Tshirt deisgn editor that can support image uploading, resizing and rotation.

### Design Requirements

1. Use the MyEAN stack (MySQL, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS).  along with fabric.js

2. Allow the ability for clients to upload, rotate and scale images and text within the editor

3. Allow multiple images to be uploaded to the canvas

4. Implement the ability to move layers forward and backward on the canvas

5. Allow the designs to be saved and reopened

Optional Features:

1. Implement an edit history for the editor


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `TshirtDesigner` repository and install the dependencies:

### Requirements

You will need these tools to set up a local development environment:

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Mysql Server](https://www.mysql.com/)

### Setup & init

In order to change Node's server environment (which by default is `local`) run this :
```
export NODE_ENV="dev"
### Clone `TshirtDesigner`
```

Clone the `TshirtDesigner` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/NeetishRaj/TshirtDesigner.git
cd TshirtDesigner
```

### Install Dependencies


To install the application we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

#### Create a user database on your local machine :

```
username : "morpheus"
password : "godOfDreams"
database : "thshirtDesign"
hostname : "localhost"
```
check config.js file


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8080/index.html`][local-app-url].

  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
```


## Testing (Pending)

There are two kinds of tests in the `TshirtDesigner` application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests.

**Tests**

```sh
$ npm test
```

<!-- **Eslint** -->

```
$ npm run eslint
```

## Serving the Application Files

While Angular is client-side-only technology and it is possible to create Angular web apps that
do not require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
web server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, XHR,
etc to function properly when an HTML page is opened via the `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.

### Running the App during Development

The `TshirtDesigner` project comes preconfigured with a local development web server. It is a Node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server]. You can start this web server with `npm start`, but you may
choose to install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own web server, such as Apache or Nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.
